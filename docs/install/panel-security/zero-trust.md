Cloudflare ZeroTrust is a powerful, free, and flexible tool that can be used to protect your Remnawave panel.

## Requirements

- Register an account with Cloudflare
- Purchase your own domain and link it to Cloudflare
- Have a payment card to attach to Cloudflare (any card will do, even with a zero balance, as long as it can be added). Once added, you’ll have access to the free Zero Trust plan.

## Instructions

The first thing we need to do after adding the domain is enable **SSL Strict**:

![SSL Strict](/security/zero-trust/ssl_strict.webp)

Next, we need to enable **Proxied** mode:

Go to https://one.dash.cloudflare.com and select your account. Then follow the steps shown in the images below:

After adding the security settings in step 7, go to **Access → Applications**, click the three dots next to your application (Edit) → **Policies → Select existing policies** on left side center, and choose your policy.

Congratulations! You’ve successfully locked down your panel from the outside world!
