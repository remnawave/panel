## Overview

In this guide we will be using Traefik as a reverse proxy to access the Remnawave panel. We will point a domain name to our server and configure Traefik. Traefik will handle the issuance of SSL certificates by itself.
Complete [Quick Start](/installation/quick-start) and [Env Variables](/installation/env) before continuing.

## Prerequisites

- Completing [Quick Start](/installation/quick-start)
- Completing [Env Variables](/installation/env)
- Registered domain name (e.g. `my-super-panel.com`)

:::warning

You need to have a registered domain name to continue.

:::

## Point domain to your server

Check your server's IP address. It is better to use a static IPv4 address.

Now, you need to point your domain name to this IP address.

For example, it will be `my-super-panel.com` -> `193.122.122.122`.

There are two ways to do this:

1. Use a DNS provider (e.g. Cloudflare, Google Cloud, etc.)
2. Use a registrar (e.g. Namecheap, etc.)

### DNS provider

If you are using Cloudflare, you need to add a A/AAAA record (for IPv4 and IPv6 respectively) to your DNS records.

Log in to your Cloudflare account [here](https://dash.cloudflare.com/login).
Select the desired domain.

On the left side of the page, click on `DNS` and then click on `Records`.

Click on `Create record`.

Set the `Type` to `A` and the `Name` to `@`.

:::info

If you want to use subdomains, you should enter the subdomain name (e.g. `panel`) in the `Name` field.

:::

Enter your server's IP address in the `IPv4 address` field.

Click on `Save`.

Now you need to wait a while for the DNS records to be updated.

:::info

There is a big difference between yellow cloud (domain is proxied by Cloudflare) and grey cloud (domain is not proxied by Cloudflare) in the Cloudflare control panel.

If Cloudflare works fine in your region, it is better to proxy the domain through Cloudflare. (Yellow cloud)

Some DNS providers have a different interface, but the overall process is the same.

## Traefik configuration

### Create docker-compose.yml

Create a `docker-compose.yml` file in the `/opt/remnawave/traefik` directory.

```bash
mkdir -p /opt/remnawave/traefik && cd /opt/remnawave/traefik && nano docker-compose.yml
```

Paste the following configuration.

```yaml title="docker-compose.yml"
services:
    traefik:
        image: traefik:latest
        container_name: traefik
        restart: unless-stopped
        security_opt:
            - no-new-privileges:true
        networks:
            - remnawave-network
        ports:
            - 80:80
            - 443:443
        environment:
            - TZ=Europe/Moscow
        volumes:
            - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro
            - ./traefik.yml:/traefik.yml:ro
            - ./letsencrypt:/letsencrypt
            - ./config:/config:ro
            - ./logs:/var/log/traefik
networks:
    remnawave-network:
        name: remnawave-network
        driver: bridge
        external: false
```

### Create static configuration file

Creating a static configuration file called `traefik.yml` in the `/opt/remnawave/traefik` directory.

```bash
cd /opt/remnawave/traefik && nano traefik.yml
```

Paste the following configuration.

:::warning

Please replace `REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_EMAIL` with your email.

Review the configuration below, look for yellow highlighted lines.

:::

```yaml title="traefik.yml"

  filePath: "/var/log/traefik/access.log"
```

### Create dynamic configuration file

Create a file called `remnawave.yml` in the `/opt/remnawave/traefik/config` directory.

```bash
mkdir -p /opt/remnawave/traefik/config && cd /opt/remnawave/traefik/config && nano remnawave.yml
```

Paste the following configuration.

:::warning

Please replace `REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_DOMAIN` with your domain name.

Review the configuration below, look for yellow highlighted lines.

:::

```yaml title="remnawave.yml"
http:
  routers:
    remnawave:
      // highlight-next-line-yellow
      rule: "Host(`REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_DOMAIN`)"
      entrypoints:
        - http
      middlewares:
        - remnawave-https-redirect
      service: remnawave

    remnawave-secure:
      // highlight-next-line-yellow
      rule: "Host(`REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_DOMAIN`)"
      entrypoints:
        - https
      middlewares:
      tls:
        certResolver: letsencrypt
      service: remnawave

  middlewares:
    remnawave-https-redirect:
      redirectScheme:
        scheme: https

  services:
    remnawave:
      loadBalancer:
        servers:
          - url: "http://remnawave:3000"
```

### Start the container

```bash
docker compose up -d && docker compose logs -f -t
```

### Open the panel in the browser

Open the configured domain name in the browser and you will see the login page.

![login-page](/reverse-proxies/nginx/login-page.webp)

### Restricting access to the panel by IP

If you want to restrict access to the panel by IP, you can create a middleware file named `ip_allow_list.yml`

```bash
cd /opt/remnawave/traefik/config && nano ip_allow_list.yml
```

Paste the following configuration.

:::warning

Please replace `REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_IP` with your allowed IP address (or ranges of allowed IPs by using CIDR notation).

Review the configuration below, look for yellow highlighted lines.

:::

:::info

If your domain name is proxied by Cloudflare, then you need to specify the IP ranges belonging to Cloudflare in the `excludedIPs` list.

Cloudflare regularly updates its IP ranges so it's a good practice to use the [official Cloudflare page](https://www.cloudflare.com/ips/) to make sure that you have an up-to-date list.

:::

```yaml title="ip_allow_list.yml"
http:
    middlewares:
        ip-allow-list:
            ipAllowList:
                sourceRange:
                    // highlight-next-line-yellow
                    - "REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_IP"
                ipStrategy:
                    excludedIPs:
                        - 73.245.48.0/20
                        - 103.21.244.0/22
                        - 103.22.200.0/22
                        - 103.31.4.0/22
                        - 141.101.64.0/18
                        - 108.162.192.0/18
                        - 190.93.240.0/20
                        - 188.114.96.0/20
                        - 197.234.240.0/22
                        - 198.41.128.0/17
                        - 162.158.0.0/15
                        - 104.16.0.0/13
                        - 104.24.0.0/14
                        - 172.64.0.0/13
                        - 131.0.72.0/22
```

Then you need to add the middleware `ip-allow-list` to the `remnawave.yml` configuration file.

```bash
nano remnawave.yml
```

Pay attention to the green line which is the one you need to add.

```yaml title="remnawave.yml"
http:
    routers:
        remnawave:
            rule: 'Host(`REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_DOMAIN`)'
            entrypoints:
                - http
            middlewares:
                - remnawave-https-redirect
            service: remnawave

        remnawave-secure:
            rule: 'Host(`REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_DOMAIN`)'
            entrypoints:
                - https
            middlewares:
                // highlight-next-line-green
                - ip-allow-list
            tls:
                certResolver: letsencrypt
            service: remnawave

    middlewares:
        remnawave-https-redirect:
            redirectScheme:
                scheme: https

    services:
        remnawave:
            loadBalancer:
                servers:
                    - url: 'http://remnawave:3000'
```

### Allowing public access to the subscription path

For the subscription system to work correctly, the `/api/sub/` path must be publicly accessible.  
At the same time, the rest of the panel should remain protected by IP-based restrictions.

To achieve this, you need to define two separate routers for the same domain â€” one for `/api/sub/` (open access), and one for everything else (restricted).

Open the file `remnawave.yml` again:

```bash
nano /opt/remnawave/traefik/config/remnawave.yml
```
Update the router configuration as follows:
```
http:
  routers:
    remnawave-sub:
      // highlight-next-line-yellow
      rule: "Host(`REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_DOMAIN`) && PathPrefix(`/api/sub/`)"
      entrypoints:
        - https
      service: remnawave
      tls:
        certResolver: letsencrypt

    remnawave-secure:
      // highlight-next-line-yellow
      rule: "Host(`REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_DOMAIN`)"
      entrypoints:
        - https
      middlewares:
        // highlight-next-line-green
        - ip-allow-list
      service: remnawave
      tls:
        certResolver: letsencrypt

  middlewares:
    remnawave-https-redirect:
      redirectScheme:
        scheme: https

  services:
    remnawave:
      loadBalancer:
        servers:
          - url: "http://remnawave:3000"
```
This configuration makes the /api/sub/ path publicly accessible, while access to the rest of the panel remains IP-restricted.
